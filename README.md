# get_started_with_java_on_azure

This repository holds the source code and bash environment commands that were used along in each learning module. I took some time to write up the the commands that worked on my commuter in the bash_commands.md file. There were times where the bash commands weren't 100% wokring. 

Along with that, there were instances where the default pom.xml files were not passing the maven build command. That was also due to the lack of Jakarta Enterprise Edtiion import statements in the Java source code. Changes to the Java code base where made where needed.

The majority of the learning modules have been included as branches in this repo. Feel free to check them out!
